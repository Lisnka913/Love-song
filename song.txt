I wrote a love song
'Cause you're so loveable
I carried a watermelon
I want to be vulnerable
I will not go to bars
Or jump in strangers' cars
Or mine sweep for wines
And lines and lines and lines and lines and lines and lines
It's not about the sex and sex and sex and sex and sex and sex
I want to be your best ever friend
Forever best friend

This modern love (Love)(4)
